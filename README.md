📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains a structured and detailed exploration of a dataset, covering various stages of data understanding, preprocessing, and visualization.

✔️ Dataset Exploration – Understanding structure, features, and missing values
✔️ Univariate Analysis – Summary statistics, distributions, and visualizations
✔️ Outlier Detection & Removal – Handling extreme values for better insights

📍 Univariate Insights:
  Summary statistics highlight key patterns in numerical features.
  Visualizations (histograms, boxplots) reveal distributions.
  
📍 Outlier Handling:
  Used IQR method to detect and remove outliers.
  
📍 Multivariate Analysis (Ongoing):
  Exploring correlations between variables to find dependencies.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 🐍
Pandas – Data manipulation 🐼
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization 📅
